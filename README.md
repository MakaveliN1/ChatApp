#Sockets based Chat-App in C#
A basic socket-based chat application in c#. Uses the System.Net and System.Net.Sockets namespace to create a TcpClient and NetworkStream, which are used to connect to a server, send and receive data over a network socket. The MainWindow class of the ChatApp namespace connects to the server on button click and the Server class creates a listening socket on a specific IP address and port, waiting for incoming connections.
Nothing fancy just something to polish basic socket based communication skills...
